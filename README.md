> Here, we use the dictionary method to recover the subsampled tactile image. And do some applications such as real-time, projectile. The method shows good result.

# Usage
Note: you need to contact the authors to get permission to access our data files.

## principle

## subsampled data acquisition
use the folder `Subsampling_Basics`. <br />
Explanation of files:
* `SubsamplingControl.m` is the main function for subsampling in three different modes: regular, random and binary.
* `SubsamplingDisplay.m` is for visualizing the subsampled tactile image.
* `downSamplingShift.m`, `randomSampling.m` and `binarySampling.m` are functions for regular, random and binary sampling methods, respectively.

## training data acquisition

## dictionary training

## data recovery
