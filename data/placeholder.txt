Download each data folder and put it into the directory data\. Each data folder is explained below.
Subsampling_Data is the folder for the data folders of the 30 daily objects;
Projectile_Data is the data folder for the application of detecting the bouncing tennis ball (the projectile);
Deformation_Data is the data folder for the application of detecting deformable objects;
Rotator_Data is the data folder for the application of the rotator;
insole_data is the data folder for the demo of the insole;
ricochet_angle_data is the data folder for the demo of determining the angles of incidence of ricochet.

The storage data structure for the subsampling tactile data is a 5-D array.
Dim 1: Store the corresponding coord and data (pressure) value.
Dim 2: For each measured sensor in one frame and for each frame in one window
Dim 3: For each window under idxM and idxMode
Dim 4: For each case with a specific num of measured sensors per frame
Dim 5: For each sampling mode
Note: For each idxM and idxMode, the num of measured sensors and the num of frames per window are different, so we need to indicate them.
Therefore, data(1,end,1,idxM,idxMode) specifies sampling rate (fs).
